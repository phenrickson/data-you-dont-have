# Playoff Simulations

The following predictions come from a game prediction model I trained on historical college football games. The inputs into the game prediction model are team level measures of offensive/defensive/special teams efficiency, which I estimate from play by play data. I simulate each game thousands of times in order to estimate the home team's win probability and expected margin of victory (or defeat).

## About the Table

**Team Ratings** refer to the team's estimated efficiency on offense and defense in terms of expected points added per play, adjusted for opponent quality.

**Win Probabilities** refer to the proportion of simulations in which the team won their matchup in each round.

## About the Table

**Quality** indicates the quality of the teams involved in the game. This is the (harmonic) mean of the two teamâ€™s power ratings and is scaled to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating a game between highly rated opponents.

**Interest** indicates how interesting a game is expected to be based on the quality of the teams and how competitive the game is expected to be. I assign every game a competitive rating using a quadratic formula applied to Pr(HomeWin), which I use along with Quality in a weighted average to produce the Interest score. This ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates a very competitive game between two highly rated opponents.

**Pr(HomeWin)** is the percentage of times that the home team won the game across every simulation.

**Prediction** is the average margin of victory for the winning team across all simulations.
